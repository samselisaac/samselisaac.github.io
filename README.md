Repository for documentation landing page for Group 5 within Info Systems Management course. 
With this HTML web page, we are submitting our documenation process for various projects within our Information Systems Management course at Saint Vincent College.
It is a simple yet effective method to tracks our methods, and for others to follow in our footsteps in the future. Our documentation is in depth and should be 
building block simplicity for any person to be able to repeat what we have accomplished.
